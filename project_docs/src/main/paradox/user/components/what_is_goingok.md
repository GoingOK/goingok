### What is GoingOK?

GoingOK is a free online reflective journal web application that is designed to assist people in recording their reflective thinking during times of personal transition. The software is [open source](https://github.com/GoingOK/goingok), and was originally developed by [Dr Andrew Gibson](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/andrew.gibson) as part of his doctoral research, in collaboration with [Dr Jill Willis](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/jill.willis) and other research academics. Both Jill and Andrew are active researchers at [Queensland University of Technology (QUT)](http://www.qut.edu.au)  Australia, and GoingOK remains an integral part of a number of [ongoing research projects](http://goingok.org). GoingOK is also used in a number of QUT units (subjects) for students to reflect on their learning.
